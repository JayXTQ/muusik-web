## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, please read further here on how to do so.

### Getting started

To get started with contributing to this project, you will need to have Node.JS installed on your machine. Install it via the [Node.JS Website](https://nodejs.org).

Once you have Node installed, you will need to fork the repository and clone it to your machine, you can use whatever to clone it. I recommend GitHub Desktop for Windows/MacOS users.

Once you have cloned the repository, you will need to install the dependencies. You can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

This will then install all the dependencies/libraries needed for this project.

### Running the project

> **Warning:** You will need to rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values for the environment variables before doing this. You will also need a supabase project with Discord OAuth enabled, learn how to set that up [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-discord).

To run the project, you will need to run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will then run the project and you will be able to access it on your localhost, for instance `http://localhost:5713` (this is default for sveltekit).

### Making changes

Once you have made your changes, commit to your fork and then you can go and make a pull request back to the main repository. Once you have done this, I will review your changes and then merge them into the main repository if the changes are good.
